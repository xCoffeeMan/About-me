Hello everyone my name is Coffeeman I recently change my name to ITrsut on discord.

I am a very friendly person who loves to learn new things even if its challenging. My goal is to work hard to make things easier on people.
I can do resourcepacks, .yml files, html, css, management and fix servers through log files or console
I can also do modpacks for people with mcreator and just modpack setups in general!

- I am currently working on a hosting company with my friend
- I am currently learning php, javascript and java and c++
Fun fact is I love coffee before work or fun! â˜•-->
